### Activity 1 

Make sure to always publish your itch link as public, so that when the graders go in to look at your work, they can actually see and play your game. I know a lot of people kept it as a private draft by action


Others by my group are to always start early on your assignments, and to always have other people constantly play testing your games

### Activity 2

1. x = 10

2. x = 2

3. For every frame, hello world will be printed to the console

4. You would use MonoBehavior

5. It prints "x = 10" into your console as soon as the code starts to run 

6. They are arguments, they are variables that are used to change your code, they let different things happen, allowing you to branch into different meathods, and just let you customize and use the code better. It lets you pass a perameter into your code. 

7. You cannot call transform of this object, as you are not specifying that you want to translate the object the script is attached to, in this instance you have to specify it. 

8. You would change transform to _playerTransform, thats it.
